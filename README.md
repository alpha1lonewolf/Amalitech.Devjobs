Creating a webpage based on the data retrieve from a local JSON file(data.json) and designing it to suite figma design.
This front end project was designed and develop with the use of HTML for creating the basic structure of the webpage,
CSS for styling the page to look similar to the figma design & javascript for the day and night functionality.
However theres still more room for improvement as the webpages design isnt a direct replica yet as it should be.
